# KP_Python_Challenge

# DETAILED README TXT

For both the pypoll and pybank challenges, I needed to create code that would mirror results in the bootcamp canvas. 

My process was slow going and frustrating at (read: most) times...I put in a lot of studying but when it came to sitting down to write the code, ==my mind went blank==.

I was particularly hung up with the Pybank challenge and how to make the code read through the csv, calculate the changes in each line, and then spit out the average (tears were spilt). After asking my class for hints and confusing Ask BCS repeatedly, I booked a tutor session and WOW, it was helpful. 

The key was to tell the code to look at the ROWS and if one row was not the same as the row above it using the not equal to code !=. I was trying to determine how I could get the row to look at COLUMNS, which was incorrect (but would come later in the code for greatest and least change in profit/losses). 

    'if previousprofit != 0:
            change = currentprofit - previousprofit
            totalchange += change
            changecounter += 1'

I also had trouble figuring out the order of operations. It wasnt until I learned about *local* and *Global* variables that things started to click. 

The Pypoll challenge was a bit easier after the pybank trial as I do understand (at a beginner, uncomplex level) the simpler concepts of python, like if statements, dictionaries, and how to calculate percentages. I definitely was still hung up on how VBA works and had a bit of whiplash from changing languages and systems. I try to keep reminding myself =="Learning and Growth come with Struggle and Discomfort".== Still uneasy about Python (WHY do coders say it's the easiest language???) but hoping I get better and better over time. 

If you've read this far, can you let me know if this is what you're looking for in a "detailed README file"?
